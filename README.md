## What Is This

I don't know why, mostly just for coding practice.

## Getting Started

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

This should start a server on http://localhost:3100/

## TODO

1. Make more sharable components out of add_item_button_group, quick_add_remove_button, and something to make the 'navbar' tabs more abstract rather than code per each page.
